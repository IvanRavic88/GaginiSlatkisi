# GaginiSlatkisi
 
GaginiSlatkisi is a website, made for a company that makes homemade cakes and other sweets. The idea is that after the launch of the site, the client has the opportunity to add and delete cakes that are on offer on its own.

The development of the site took about a month and the goal was to go through all the stages of creating a application like this. From designing in Figma, through HTML and CSS, then the background part in Flask (with the ability to send emails, add and delete cookies in the database), to the deploy website on VPS, with the installation of Ubunt operating system and installing all the necessary tools to run the application itself. Nginx and Gunicorn were used for the this Flask application on server side.
